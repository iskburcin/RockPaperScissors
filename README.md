# RockPaperScissors
The game is producing a random state in 3 possibilities then shows result which player wins 

When you enter the code in your IDE, then run, the program will need to get your input to choose how many round do you want to play. 
After you enter your response, the game produce all the round result for each player, and the end of the output you are going to see the final score.

I entered the 3, then the output looks like that.
